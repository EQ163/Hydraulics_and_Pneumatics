## Use of Counters (Electric and Pneumatic)

Problem Statement - Washers for injection pumps are to be cleaned in a cleaning bath. A double acting cylinder is used to dip a container with washers in and out of the cleaning bath. A push button is used to start the cleaning cycle. After reaching the forward end position, cylinder should oscillate between S2 and S3 for 10 times and on completion should stop in retracted position and actuate limit switch,S1. Next cycle should
be possible only after 20 sec.

In both these videos operation of push button when timer has not been completed doesnt allow the next cycle to start. Also the piston oscillates between S2 and S3 whose count is maintained by counter.
