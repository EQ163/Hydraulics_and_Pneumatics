Problem Statement - Washers for injection pumps are to be cleaned in a cleaning bath. A double acting cylinder is used to dip a container with washers in and out of the cleaning bath. A push button is used to start the cleaning cycle. After reaching the forward end position, cylinder should oscillate between S2 and S3 for 10 times and on completion should stop in retracted position and actuate limit switch,S1. Next cycle should
be possible only after 20 sec.

**Purely Pneumatic Circuit**

In both these videos operation of push button when timer has not been completed doesnt allow the next cycle to start. Also the piston oscillates between S2 and S3 whose count is maintained by counter.

Problem Statement - After the liquid paint colors have been poured together into a bucket, they are mixed in by the vibrating machine.
When a push button has been pressed, the extended cylinder retracts completely and executes a to and fro movement in the rear stroke range. The oscillating is limited to the retracted end position by a roller lever valve as well as a second roller lever valve in the central position. The frequency of oscillating is adjustable within its limits by setting a pressure regulator controlling the amount of air supply. Set an operating pressure of p = 4 bar.
After a specified interval, the oscillator is switched off. The double acting cylinder extends
completely and actuates the third roller lever valve. Set a vibration time of t = 5 seconds.

Problem Statement - Quarry stones are fed from a crushing roller to two vibrating sieves by means of an overhead conveyor belt. The fine upper sieves oscillate in opposing push pull motion to the coarser lower screen. The sieve oscillating frequency of the two double acting cylinders is set to f = 1 Hz via the quantity of air supplied in load dependent relation. Reversal takes place in the retracted end position via two roller lever valves. A third single acting cylinder unclogs the sieves via two cables. The stone sorter is switched on and off
by a valve with selector switch.
